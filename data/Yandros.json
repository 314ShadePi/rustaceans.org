    "notes": "A rustacean passionate about in-depth understanding of things, and thus, someone who enjoys explaining (teaching?) stuff. I like the functional-style type-level abstractions and safeties of Rust, as well as its tweakability for low-level code, such as FFI. Quite (too?) fond of macros and meta-programming as well ðŸ™ƒ\nI may sometimes experiment with alternative formattings, don't judge me too harshly for that ðŸ˜‰"
